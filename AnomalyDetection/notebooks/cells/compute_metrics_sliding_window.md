# Compute metrics for evaluation

To evaluate the model, metrics must be computed. To be complete in the metrics computation, we will compute the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, average precision score, precision recall AUC and ROC AUC. Of each of these metrics we can even compute graphics to visualize the performance of the model.
